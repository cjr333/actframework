# Act.framework

## Why Act.framework?
> I loved PlayFramework v1.x because it was simple, clear and expressive. It brought us a completely different experience in web development with Java. However I don't totally agree with where Play 2.X is heading.
I had thought of rolling out something that could follow the road paved by Play 1.x; something that is simple, clear, expressive and developer friendly.
In short, we need a modern, sleek Java MVC framework which we don't get from Spring MVC, Sprint Boot, PlayFramework, SparkFramework or any others on the market

## Features
### A full stack MVC framework
> Act is not a servlet framework and Act application does not run in a Servlet container
### Unbeatable development experience with great performance
> Act.Framework supports hot-reload applications and it takes less than a second to reload your normal sized app
> According to this benchmark project, Act.Framework is 20 times faster than Spring boot in simple cases.
### Dependency injection
> Fully JSR 330 support and even more
### Annotation aware but not annotation stack
### Multi-environment configuration
> Act.Framework supports the concept of profile which allows you to organize your configurations in different environment (defined by profile) easily.
### Simple yet powerful database support
> Act.Framework provides a decent set of database access APIs via act.db.Dao and relevant interfaces. (act-ebean, act-morphia)
### Powerful view architecture with multiple render engine support
> Act.Framework by default uses the Rythm Template Engine.
> Act.Framework support using multiple template - like velocity, mustache.. - engines in the same projects.
